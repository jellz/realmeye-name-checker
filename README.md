# realmeye-name-checker
Program to find available two-letter names in RealmEye API (for Toro)

This program scrapes [realmeye.com](https://realmeye.com) and checks the player profile for each two-letter name (names are case-insensitive so it only checks a-z).

A file with the list of available names is created in the working directory after the program is finished, and the file is automatically opened.

Run the program in the terminal to use it. You can use `--debug` to run a test with a short list of names.
